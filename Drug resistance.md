DRUG RESISTANCE IN CANCER TREATMENT

     Drug resistance is a major challenge in both antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and cancer treatment and is responsible for up to 90% of the cancer related deaths \[1,2]. In cancer, drug resistance refers to the inability of cancer cells to withstand the effects of chemotherapy rendering treatment less effective/ ineffective \[3]. Various mechanisms contribute to drug resistance, including drug activation, efflux, DNA repair, cell death inhibition, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition \[1]. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing effective strategies to combat resistance, with combination and personalized therapies showing promise \[3]. Drug resistance can be classified as intrinsic or acquired depending on the time the resistance developed. Intrinsic resistance exists before therapy while acquired resistance develops after the commencement of therapy with each occurring in about 50% of cancer patients \[4,5].

      Intrinsic drug resistance may exist in cancer cells prior to therapies due to the presence of genetic mutation(s) of genes involved in cancer cell growth and/or apoptosis. For example, poorer outcome of cisplatin treatment in gastric cancer patients was found to be associated with HER2 overexpression \[6]. Acquired resistance can be identified by gradual reduction of anticancer efficacy of a drug after the drug treatment. Acquired resistance can be a result of: activation of second proto-oncogene that becomes the newly emerged driver gene; mutations or altered expression levels of the drug targets; changes in tumor microenvironment (TME) after treatment \[3]. Shrunk tumors can acquire resistance and regrow due to new mutations. In one study, genomic profiles before and after relapse of eight acute myeloid leukemia patients were analyzed using whole-genome sequencing \[7]. The comparison of mutations between primary and relapse tumors revealed novel gene mutations. In addition, the results showed increased transversion mutations in relapsed tumors, suggesting that cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs caused DNA damage in cancer cells and might increase probability of the emergence of new mutations \[7]. Mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired resistance can co-exist during tumor progression and treatment \[3].
