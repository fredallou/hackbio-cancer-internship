**Activity of new antibacterial products on priority pathogens**

**Introduction**
Antimicrobial resistance has contributed to numerous fatalities globally and has emerged as a significant concern in recent years. The efficacy of most antibacterial agents against priority pathogens is diminished due to social and environmental factors, particularly stemming from consumers' misuse of these drugs. (Health data, 2019[\[GD1\]](#_msocom_1) )
This report aims to summarize the data from the WHO AMR pipeline analysis on some new antibacterial products and their effectiveness on priority pathogens. (World Health Organization, 2021[\[GD2\]](#_msocom_2) )

**F1: Distribution of Product Type**

This shows 383 traditional antibiotics and 283 non-traditional products in the pipeline. While many efforts focus on improving conventional antibiotics, nearly half explore innovative approaches like bacteriophages, probiotics, and immune modulators, balancing existing treatments with new strategies.

**Figure 2: Distribution of AMR Products by R\&D Phase**

Considering the research and development phases, the majority of the tested products (46.3%) are in Phase 1 while Preregistration happened to be the phase with the least number of AMR Products (4.03%).

**Figure 3: The distribution of Active against priority pathogens**

Out of the 267 antibacterial entries tested, a total of 146 (54.6%) showed activity against priority pathogens.

**Figure 4: Frequency of antibacterial activity against Priority Pathogens**

Critical priority pathogens have the highest number of active products, indicating a strong research focus. Significant activity targets Gram-positive infections like Staphylococcus aureus. However, lower product counts for pathogens such as _Helicobacter pylori_ and _Campylobacter spp_. highlight the need for increased research and development efforts in these challenging areas.

**Figure 5: Shows a graph of the “Number of Yes for Active pathogens by Product name”**

This effectively highlights the efficacy of different products. Rhu-pGSN showed the greatest antibacterial activity. Other products show varying levels of activity.

**Figure 6: Product name against active priority pathogens**

We evaluated how well the products work against critical pathogens. “Yes” means the pathogen is susceptible, “No” means it’s resistant, and “Possibly” indicates the need for more research to improve effectiveness.

**Figure 7: Product distribution across R\&D phases**

This highlights 27 products that made it to the Preregistration phase. Indicating that “BB128”, “AB103”, and “Solithromycin” might be the only products to hit the market soon

**Discussion**
The evaluation of pharmaceutical products against critical priority pathogens revealed varying levels of effectiveness and resistance. The assessment categorizes responses as "Yes" (susceptible), "No" (resistant), and "Possibly" (uncertain, requiring further research). Products such as Rhu-pGSN, Bacteriophage, and others achieved 100% efficacy against their targeted pathogens. Conversely, Zolifiodacin, Afabicin, and others showed mixed results with susceptibility and resistance, highlighting the need for further innovation. Other drugs like TXA709 and KBP-7072 exhibited varied outcomes ("Yes," "No," "Possibly"), suggesting possible pathogen mutations and resistance gene acquisition. Some products, including TRL1068 and QPX7728, demonstrated partial efficacy, indicating they are not entirely effective and need additional research. XNW4107 and related drugs showed "Possibly" outcomes, reflecting insufficient efficacy. These results stress the importance of continued research to improve drug effectiveness and address resistance issues.

**Conclusion**
The varied efficacy and resistance profiles of these drugs highlight the need for ongoing research to enhance their effectiveness and combat the risk of pathogen resistance.
